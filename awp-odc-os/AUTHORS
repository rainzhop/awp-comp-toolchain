The AWP-ODC-GPU software is a C/CUDA/MPI based seismic wave propagation code, first developed by Jun Zhou and Yifeng Cui in 2013 at High Performance Geocomputing Laboratory (HPGeoC) of University of California, San Diego, its numerical algorithm is based on the work related to the CPU-based AWP-ODC which is an abbreviation of Anelastic Wave Propagation by Olsen, Day & Cui in 2010. The original AWP wave propagation code was developed by Kim Bak Olsen at University of Utah in 1994, then underwent many enhancements and optimizations by Kim Olsen and Steven Day of SDSU, and Yifeng Cui of UCSD etc.

This GPU-based software package is maintained and developed by the HPGeoC development team from University of California, San Diego, authors are in alphabetical order:

Dongju Choi,
Yifeng Cui,
Efecan Poyraz,
Jun Zhou.
